## 4. Methods

The study uses python programming language specifically collections, intertools and tabulate python libraries to simulate a Yahtzee game based on Monte Carlo probability methods. The model tracked scores and bonuses to measure the performance prioritizing the upper section versus the lower section in a game play. The methods are detailed in the following paragraphs. 

**4.1 Monte Carlo Simulation**
Monte Carlo Simulation is a method of estimating the outcome of a population by repeating an experiment n times and averaging the total outcome. The Monte Carlo model applies the law of large numbers, which states that the average of many independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables will converge to the expected value as the number of samples goes to infinity. So, to estimate the expected value of a function E f(x), random numbers are run through the function, and then the results are averaged to arrive at an estimate of μ (Equation 1). Where μ ̂ is the sample mean, an estimate of the true mean μ, X_i are the points, and n is the number of samples taken.


This makes Monte Carlo an ideal method for estimating the strategy outcomes of a simple Yahtzee game compared to other methods of determining strategy outcomes, such as a Markov Decision Process. However, the model comes with its own limitations, such as slow convergence and the inability to learn from previous games. The Markov Decision Process addresses these limitations by modeling multiple states using Bellman equations and matrices but trades this advanced technique for higher computational processing, a key limiting factor in this study. Regardless of these limitations, the simplicity and scalability of the Monte Carlo model make it very practical for this study.

**4.2 Statistics and Random Number Generation.**

The method of evaluation was based on basic summary statistics generated by the simulation model. These statistics included the average score, best and worst scores, and average performance across scoring categories. The random number generator used was the built-in generator from Python’s random module. This module uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm as its core generator, which produces 53-bit precision floating-point numbers and has a period of 2^19937-1. This pseudo random number generator ensures that every number within the specified range has an equal chance of being selected, minimizing the appearance of patterns. Although the Mersenne Twister is deterministic in nature, it is considered suitable for the purposes of this simulation study due to its proven extended cycle randomness and long period.

**4.3 The Model - A Strategy Simulation**

The Yahtzee simulation model used in this study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies over full game plays. The model applies the Monte Carlo method by simulating individual dice rolls, rerolls, and scoring decisions based on predefined strategies. For each game, the simulation rolled five dice, identified the best dice to hold based on the current strategy, rerolled the remaining dice up to two times, and then selected the category that would maximize the score for that turn. The model follows all standard Yahtzee scoring rules, with the exception of the Joker Rule, which was omitted due to its complexity and lack of valuable input to the objectives investigated.

Two primary strategies were evaluated: one that prioritized the upper section to maximize the 35-point bonus, and another that prioritized the lower section. Unlike other simulation models such as decision trees, the Monte Carlo approach is memoryless, which increases the risk of wasting high rolls on low-scoring categories or duplicating scoring entries. To address this, each roll was logged into a scorecard to ensure proper category tracking. While the model does not incorporate formal gameplay optimization, which would require advanced understanding of professional-level strategy, it successfully meets the objectives outlined for this study.
